-- MULTI JOIN
-- NOTE: Its good practice to do no more than 3 joins in a multijoin.
-- Start from the actor table, join to the film_actor table, join to the film table
SELECT first_name, last_name, title
FROM actor
INNER JOIN film_actor
ON actor.actor_id=film_actor.actor_id
INNER JOIN film
ON film_actor.film_id=film.film_id
INNER JOIN film_category
ON film.film_id=film_category.film_id
INNER JOIN category
on film_category.category_id=category.category_id;

-- Subqueries
-- You can use subqueries 3 different ways
-- SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses


-- WHERE is the most common
-- SELECT is the most uncommon

-- Query 1: Find all customer_ids that have spent more than $175
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(amount) > 175;

-- group by == for each


-- Query 2: Get all customer info
SELECT *
FROM customer
WHERE customer_id = 341;


-- NOW our subquery to combine them together using WHERE and IN

SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name
FROM customer
WHERE customer_id IN(
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM payment
    GROUP BY customer_id
    HAVING SUM(amount) > 175
);

-- Another Subquery Example (adding joins)
-- query first_name, last_name actors that worked on the movie "Mulan Moon"
SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name
FROM actor
WHERE actor_id IN(
    SELECT actor_id
    FROM film_actor
    INNER JOIN film
    ON film_actor.film_id=film.film_id
    WHERE title = 'Mulan Moon'
);
